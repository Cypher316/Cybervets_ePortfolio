# Welcome to my ePortfolio!![cybervets logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106770874/171731474-46e38e5b-0837-4254-bdee-0c74bca947a7.jpg)

Hello, my name is Celisse Carr, and welcome to my ePortfolio, where I will showcase the progress I am making during the 6-month CMS Cybervets apprenticeship.

## ABOUT ME

I was born and raised in Boston, MA and I am currently stationed at Joint Base Andrews, MD where I have decided to settle down once my active duty contract has ended. I have spent the last 6 years working as a Security Forces member in the US Air Force,  where I  gained skills in federal law enforcement as well as electronic security systems. 
Joining the Air Force afforded me the opportunity to travel and work toward my education.

Why Cyber?
	
I have always been drawn to Criminal Justice. I joined the Air Force with the goal of becoming a Federal Law Enforcement officer. I quickly realized that criminals no longer walk into banks dressed like the ham-burglar and rob it (like the good old days). These days, crimes are being committed behind the screens, so in order to stay relevant in the criminal catching business, a certain degree of technical savvy is required. And I have always been drawn to the investigative side of criminal justice, following the clues, collecting evidence, and declaring who the bad guy is in the library with the candlestick!
	
The part about cybersecurity that is most appealing to me is the ability to tap into my naturally investigative and inquiring mind. I enjoy the continuous learning.  I am driven and motivated by learning new things, and I am excited to be jumping into a career that is always changing will allow me to change and grow along with it. The job I had in the air force had a limit to the things you could learn, and often bred complacency. In the world of cyber, you are expected and incentivized to continue learning, continue growing , and continue improving. 

Future Goals

I intend to continue my education either by perusing a masters degree or a certification program through the SANS institute. 

## Education

I hold an Associates in Criminal Justice from the Community College of the Air Force , and will be Graduating University of Maryland Global Campus in December 2022 with a Bachelors in Cybersecurity Technology, and an Undergraduate Certification in Cyber Threat Hunting.
	
## Work Experience
	
During my time in the Aviano, Italy I managed two COMSEC Controlled Areas, and was given the opportunity to work along side Atlantic CommTech contractors as well as active duty cyber professionals to conduct developmental and operational testing of a new alarm system infrastructure. I spent 6 weeks at Ramstein Air Force Base testing intrusion detection system alarm points, as well as network and system security configurations. At the conclusion of the 6 weeks, I was asked to return to Norfolk, VA as a security forces consultant on the technical order validation, ensuring that the new system met the standards set in place by the DoD, USAFE, and Nuclear Weapons Center.
	
While stationed at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, I worked as a Desk Sergeant in the Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC), where I dispatched to all security or law enforcement incidents that occured on the installation. My office also coordinated executive aircraft security movements, and counter-SUAS operations (drone detection) across the entire National Capital Region.

## Projects

The [Projects](https://github.com/Cypher316/Cybervets_ePortfolio/projects?type=new) are broken down into categories:
* [Technical Skills](https://github.com/users/Cypher316/projects/7) - Here are examples of hands-on technical training I have completed. They are broken down by platform, to include Escalate, SANS Holiday Hack, Splunk, TryHackMe, and codeacademy. Each challenge includes screenshots, successful commands, and the trial and error notes taken for each challenge. Completing this was very beneficial to me, as I was able to reinforce my learning, and I find myself refering back to these often when facing a simaler challenge. 
* [Education](https://github.com/users/Cypher316/projects/4) - Here, I have documented my formal education thus far as I approach graduation from University of Maryland Global Campus. I have included completed classes, those I have scheduled, as well as future education goals. Under each of the completed courses, I have included original projects to demonstrate some of the skills gained along the way.
* [Acheivements and Credentials](https://github.com/users/Cypher316/projects/8) - This section includes some of my military accolades from my time in the US Air Force. This is not an all-inclusive list, but the ones that I am most proud of.
